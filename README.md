# IBM Quantum Challenge 2020
My solutions for the <b>[IBM Quantum Challenge 2020](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/challenges)</b>, held between April and May.

The badge I earned for the successful completion of the challenges can be found [here](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/90a8876e-bfc7-4e73-9338-878a7601c22f/public_url).

### Important Note
Certain media in the Jupyter Notebooks may be broken due to their dependency on the IBM services while the Challenge was live.
